Responses (sent from server to all clients, unless stated otherwise):
	"connect <id>"			Sent when a client connects.
	"disconnect <id>"		Sent when a client disconnects.
	"error"					Operation failed. "error WrongMode" is sent on all operations if not in the right mode (e.g. "insert" with no previous "newgame" or "loadgame"). Custom errors are noted. Only sent to client that caused it.
	"savestate <text>"		The current SaveState as JSON: {"score": int, "maxScore": int, "number": int, "board": [[{"num": int, "prio": int"}, next cell in column], next column array]}
	"clear"					Sent after an "insert" that caused a board clear. The game will wait for a "clearoption <y/n> <top/bottom/left/right>", details there.
	"savegamelist <list>"	Response to "listsavegames". Only sent to the client that the first command originated from. JSON: {["name1", "name2" ...]}
	"stopped"				Response to "stopserver". All clients are expected to shut down their connections after receiving this.

Game management:
	"newgame"				Starts a new game. Responds with "savestate"
	"getgame"				Responds with "savestate" when a game is running.
